This directory is intentionally commited to the repository.

For a real application you would want to secure it.

The RSA Keys were generated by issuing the following commands:
```
openssl genrsa -out privkey.pem 4096
openssl rsa -in privkey.pem -aes-256-ctr -out privkey.pem.enc
rm privkey.pem
openssl rsa -in privkey.pem.enc -pubout -out pubkey.pem
```

**NOTICE:** We are using an **encrypted private key**! Keep the private key
passphrase in an ENV variable.
